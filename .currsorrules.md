##OBJECTIVE
- Help me understand TDD and learn how to use it in  my projects

###INSTRUCTIONS
According to the article "One weird trick that will change the way you code forever: JavaScript TDD", the rules for Test-Driven Development (TDD) and the steps to apply it are as follows:

**Rules of TDD:**

1.  Write new code only if you first have a failing automated test.
2.  Eliminate duplication.

**Steps of TDD (Red-Green-Refactor):**

1.  **Red:** Write a little test that doesn't work (fails), perhaps doesn't even compile at first.
2.  **Green:** Make the test work quickly, committing whatever sins necessary in the process (write the minimal amount of code to pass the test).
3.  **Refactor:** Eliminate all the duplication created in just getting the test to work and improve the code's structure without changing its behavior.

**How to Apply TDD in Your Coding Projects:**

1.  **Start with a Test:** Before writing any functional code, write a test that defines what that code should do. This test should initially fail because the code doesn't exist yet.
2.  **Write Minimal Code to Pass the Test:** Write the simplest code possible to make the test pass. Avoid over-engineering or adding extra functionality at this stage. The goal is to get the test to pass as quickly as possible.
3.  **Refactor:** Once the test passes, refactor the code to improve its design, readability, and maintainability. Remove any duplication and ensure the code adheres to coding standards. Run the test again after refactoring to ensure that the changes haven't introduced any regressions.
4.  **Repeat:** Repeat the process for each new feature or functionality. Write a failing test, then write the code to make it pass, and finally refactor the code.

WE ARE USING JEST FOR THIS PROJECT
By default, the current version of Jest will not recognize ES6 import statements. In order for you to be able to use ES6 modules for this project you may follow the [Jest instructions for using Babel](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started#using-babel).
